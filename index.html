    		<h3>Early History</h3>
        		<p>The phonautograph, patented by Léon Scott in 1857, used a vibrating diaphragm and stylus to 				              graphically record sound waves as tracings on sheets of paper, purely for visual analysis and              without any idea of playing them back. These tracings can now be scanned and digitally converted              into audible sound. Phonautograms of singing and speech made by Scott in 1860 were played back as              sound for the first time in 2008. Along with a tuning fork tone and unintelligible snippets recorded              as early as 1857, these are the earliest known recordings of sound.In 1877, Thomas Edison invented 					the phonograph. Unlike the phonautograph, it was capable of both recording and reproducing sound. Despite the similarity of name, there is no documentary evidence that Edison's phonograph was based on Scott's phonautograph. Edison first tried recording sound on a wax-impregnated paper tape, with the idea of creating a "telephone repeater" analogous to the "telegraph repeater" he had been working. Although the visible results made him confident that sound could be physically recorded and reproduced.

        	<h3>Record Albums</h3>
        		<p>Such 78 rpm records were usually sold separately, in brown paper or cardboard sleeves that were sometimes plain and sometimes printed to show the producer or the retailer's name. Generally the sleeves had a circular cut-out allowing the record label to be seen. Records could be laid on a shelf horizontally or stood upright on an edge, but because of their fragility, many broke in storage.German record company Odeon is often said to have pioneered the "album" in 1909 when it released the Nutcracker Suite by Tchaikovsky on 4 double-sided discs in a specially designed package.[26] (It is not indicated what size the records are.) However, Deutsche Grammophon had produced an album for its complete recording of the opera Carmen in the previous year. The practice of issuing albums does not seem to have been widely taken up by other record companies for many years; however, HMV provided an album, with a pictorial cover, for the 1917 recording ofThe Mikado (Gilbert & Sullivan). By about 1910[note 1] bound collections of empty sleeves with a paperboard or leather cover, similar to a photograph album, were sold as "record albums".

    		<h3>78 RPM Recording</h3>
        		<p>The playing time of a phonograph record depended on the turntable speed and the groove spacing. At the beginning of the 20th century, the early discs played for two minutes, the same as early cylinder records.[17] The 12-inch disc, introduced by Victor in 1903, increased the playing time to three and a half minutes.[18] Because a 10-inch 78 rpm record could hold about three minutes of sound per side and the 10-inch size was the standard size for popular music, almost all popular recordings were limited to around three minutes in length. For example, when King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, including Louis Armstrong on his first recordings, recorded 13 sides at Gennett Records in Richmond, Indiana, in 1923, one side was 2:09 and four sides were 2:52–2:59. By 1938, when Milt Gabler started recording on January 17 for his new label, Commodore Records, to allow longer continuous performances, he recorded some 12-inch records. Eddie Condon explained: "Gabler realized that a jam session needs room for development." The first two 12-inch recordings did not take advantage of the extra length.
